**Group 3: Alexandra Anthony, Sara Gaber, Ahmad Shah, Neeti Mistry, & Sohan Chatterjee**


# Health Monitoring App
- Every group opting for this project will be provided with a Fitbit Inspire 2.
- Develop a system that seamlessly incorporates health data from smart hardware into a web app through an API.
  - Emphasize the integration of hardware, with a reduced emphasis on UI functions, maintaining the essence of a web app.
- Generate interactive charts and graphs for visualizing health data, including:
  - Bar plots illustrating steps taken for each hour of the day.
  - Comparison of Heart Rate (BPM) and Zone Minutes during intense workouts.
- Create profile for the user.
- Conduct trend analysis based on the insights derived from the interactive charts.

# Function Checklist
- Establish authentication and integration with the Fitbit API
  - Clarification: API stands for Application Programming Interface, facilitating communication between different programs
- Develop and implement user profile setup and editing features.
- Develop interactive tools for visualizing data.
- Create options for metric and time view customization.
- Build a system for establishing and tracking health goals.
- Enable manual input of health data, such as food intake.

# Milestone 1
- Complete Paper Prototyping
- Complete Usability Testing (afte paper prototyping is done)
  - 2 to 3 Participants (can't be from our class)
  - Create video (Record the process with the consent of the participants)
  - Use project specific roles to gather insights
  - Members of your team should take the 3 roles:
      - one facilitator
      - one human-computer to simulate participant's intention with the interface
      - one or two observers
   
# Milestone 2
- Create UML diagrams for the project
- Before starting, we recommend your group flesh out a set of requirements, and then use those requirements when creating your diagrams
- Create 3 UML diagrams:
  1. Use case diagram
  2. Activity diagram
  3. Class diagram
- These diagrams should be created with digital apps, not hand-drawn
- You should follow the standard symbols and notations of each diagram
- Please submit your diagrams in PDF format
- For the health tracking app, consider the users: health coach and participant
- Then create and submit slides for your milestone 2:
    - Introduction
    - Use case diagram
    - Activity diagram
    - Class diagram
    - Summary

# Milestone 3
- Create Interface, Implement API
- Project Summary: your task is to implement the functions of the application. The following system requirements must be met.
  - Functions
    - baseline of the frontend and backend: user login, FitBit oauth, displaying user FitBit data, navigation, and basic user interface
- Demo and Presentation
  - A brief intro to your team work, in terms of language, platform, team member responsibilities, effort estimation (hours, lines of code, number of commits). You can use screen shot from Github as supporting materials. Please include the URL of your Github project in the slides.
  - A demo of the required functions
  - A summary of challenges and strength in your team work.
  - Any iterative changes you have made to your UML diagrams, as a result of your implementation.  (Remember, good design means that your UML diagrams always reflect your code exactly.)
  - Please submit your slides in the pdf format to this assignment on Canvas.

# Milestone 4
- Project Summary: your task is to implement the functions of the application. The following system requirements must be met:
- Clean up and implement remaining features, such as setting goals, graphical displays, and more
- Interactive Graphs of Health Trends
  - Bar plot of steps taken for each hour of the day
  - Heart rate (BPM) vs Zone Minutes (during an intense workout)
- Being able to interact with the app as a user and coach
