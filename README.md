# Health Monitoring App
- Every group opting for this project will be provided with a Fitbit Inspire 2.
- Develop a system that seamlessly incorporates health data from smart hardware into a web app through an API.
  - Emphasize the integration of hardware, with a reduced emphasis on UI functions, maintaining the essence of a web app.
- Generate interactive charts and graphs for visualizing health data, including:
  - Bar plots illustrating steps taken for each hour of the day.
  - Comparison of Heart Rate (BPM) and Zone Minutes during intense workouts.
- Create profile for the user.
- Conduct trend analysis based on the insights derived from the interactive charts.

# Function Checklist
- Establish authentication and integration with the Fitbit API
  - Clarification: API stands for Application Programming Interface, facilitating communication between different programs
- Develop and implement user profile setup and editing features.
- Develop interactive tools for visualizing data.
- Create options for metric and time view customization.
- Build a system for establishing and tracking health goals.
- Enable manual input of health data, such as food intake.

# Milestone 1
- Complete Paper Prototyping
- Complete Usability Testing (afte paper prototyping is done)
  - 2 to 3 Participants (can't be from our class)
  - Create video (Record the process with the consent of the participants)
  - Use project specific roles to gather insights
  - Members of your team should take the 3 roles:
      - one facilitator
      - one human-computer to simulate participant's intention with the interface
      - one or two observers
   
# Milestone 2
- Create UML diagrams for the project
- Before starting, we recommend your group flesh out a set of requirements, and then use those requirements when creating your diagrams
- Create 3 UML diagrams:
  1. Use case diagram
  2. Activity diagram
  3. Class diagram
- These diagrams should be created with digital apps, not hand-drawn
- You should follow the standard symbols and notations of each diagram
- Please submit your diagrams in PDF format
- For the health tracking app, consider the users: health coach and participant
- Then create and submit slides for your milestone 2:
    - Introduction
    - Use case diagram
    - Activity diagram
    - Class diagram
    - Summary

# Milestone 3
- Create Interface, Implement API
